#WRAMP Assembly Language#

**Hello!**

It is my hope, (assuming you are a Waikato Student) that these tools will help with your WRAMP programming. This should enable code highlighting 
and completion for any *.s file. Good luck with the programming!

**NOTE**: *This was not created by the staff of the University of Waikato, only by a curious student.*
